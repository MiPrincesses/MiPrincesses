-- Welcome to the Kingdom of SQL! Let's track the Princess' sessions and their wait statuses.
-- Query for blocked sessions (deadlock candidates), now featuring Princesses and Knights!

SELECT 
    -- The "BlockedSessionID" is like the Princess trapped in a tower (blocked and waiting for rescue).
    r.session_id AS PrincessInTheTower, 
    
    -- The "BlockingSessionID" is the Knight blocking the Princess' path (the one causing the wait).
    r.blocking_session_id AS BraveKnightBlockingPath,
    
    -- The "RequestStatus" is the status of our Princess, whether she's trapped or free.
    r.status AS PrincessStatus,
    
    -- The "WaitType" is the reason the Princess is waitingâ€”perhaps a dragon or a locked door!
    r.wait_type AS EnchantedBarrier,
    
    -- The "WaitTime" is how long the Princess has been waiting for the Knight to save her.
    r.wait_time AS TimeSpentInTheTower

-- Only look at those Princesses that are stuck in the tower, waiting for a Knight to rescue them.
FROM sys.dm_exec_requests r
WHERE r.blocking_session_id <> 0;  -- Exclude Princesses who are already free
